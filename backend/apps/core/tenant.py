"""
Thread-local tenant context for cross-tenant data isolation.

This module is intentionally kept separate from the middleware that
populates it (``apps.core.middleware.tenant``) so that model managers
and querysets can read the current tenant without importing the
middleware (which would create a circular import in some code paths).

The context is populated by :class:`TenantContextMiddleware` on every
authenticated request and cleared in a ``finally`` block to prevent
bleed-through between requests served by the same worker thread.
